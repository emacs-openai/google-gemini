# google-gemini
> Elisp library for the Google Gemini API

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-openai/google-gemini/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-openai/google-gemini/actions/workflows/test.yml)

The [Google Gemini][] Elisp library provides convenient access to the Gemini API from
applications written in the Elisp language. 

*P.S. This package is expected to be used as a library, so there are only a few
interactable commands you can use, and those are mostly examples.*

## üìö Documentation

- [Google AI for Developers - REST API](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/rest_quickstart)

## üî® Usage

You will need to set up your API key before you can use this library.

```elisp
(setq google-gemini-key "[YOUR API KEY]")
```

Alternatively you can configure a function to retrieve the key from some
external source. A function, `google-gemini-key-auth-source` is provided to
retrieve the key from an auth-source entry under the `:host` key `api.google-gemini.com`

```elisp
(setq google-gemini-key #'google-gemini-key-auth-source)
```

> üí° Tip
>
> The two variables `google-gemini-key` is the default values for sending requests!
> However, you can still overwrite the value by passing the keywords `:key`!

## üî∞ The simplest example

Here is the simplest example that teaches you how to use this library.
This is a function with a `query` and a callback function.

```elisp
(google-gemini-content-generate "How are you?"
                                (lambda (data)
                                  (message "%s" data)))
```

## üì® Sending Request

All arguments are exposed in the argument list, so you can send any request in any way you want.

For example, the request function `google-gemini-content-generate` accepts
argument max-tokens. By seeing Google Gemini's references page:

> Max output tokens: Specifies the maximum number of tokens that can be generated
> in the response. A token is approximately four characters. 100 tokens correspond
> to roughly 60-80 words.

```elisp
(google-gemini-content-generate ...
                                ...
                                :max-output-tokens 100)  ; Get roughly 60-80 words!
```

$ eask package
$ eask install
```

To test compilation:

```sh
$ eask compile
```

**ü™ß The following steps are optional, but we recommend you follow these lint results!**

The built-in `checkdoc` linter:

```sh
$ eask lint checkdoc
```

The standard `package` linter:

```sh
